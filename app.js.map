You don't have to worry about whether a\n            transition has actually started or not as this is handled internally by React CSS Transition.\n          </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n            {onTransitionCompleteSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          <div className={classes.block}>\n            <Demo\n              title=\"Completion Example\"\n              component={CompletionExample}\n              source={completionExampleSource}\n              />\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className={classes.mainSection}>\n          <h3>Perform Transition Upon Mount</h3>\n          <p>\n            A component can be mounted initially in the <em>active state</em>, in this case no transition will\n            take place. If you want to perform a transition from the <em>default</em> to\n            the <em>active state</em> upon mount, you can enable the <code>transitionAppear</code> flag.\n          </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n            {transitionAppearSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          <div className={classes.block}>\n            <Demo title=\"Appear Example\" component={AppearExample} source={appearExampleSource} />\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className={classes.mainSection}>\n          <h3>The CSS Transition Group</h3>\n          <p>\n            React CSS Transition exports another component called <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code> that you can\n            use to perform a transition whenever a child component leaves or enters the\n            DOM. <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code> passes the\n            properties <code>active</code> and <code>transitionAppear</code> to its children\n            and uses the <code>onTransitionComplete</code> property to track the\n            transition. This means that the child components must all be wrapped with\n            the <code>CSSTransition</code> component or handle the above properties\n            themselves.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The resulting tree should look something like this:\n          </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"bash\">\n            {groupTreeSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          <div className={classes.block}>\n            <Demo title=\"Transition Group Example\" component={GroupExample} source={groupExampleSource} />\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            Let's predefine a <code>CSSTransition</code>:\n          </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n            {groupTranistionSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          <p>\n            Finally create a component that fades in and out its children:\n          </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n            {groupSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n\n          <section className={classes.mainSection}>\n            <h4>Appear on Initial Mount</h4>\n            <p>\n              If you mount the <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code> together with some children at the same time,\n              no transition will be triggered unless you set <code>transitionAppear=true</code> on\n              the <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code>.\n            </p>\n            <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n              {transitionAppearSnippet}\n            </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          </section>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className={classes.mainSection}>\n          <h3>Rendering a Different Component</h3>\n          <p>\n            Both <code>CSSTransition</code> and <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code> renders as a <code>div</code> component\n            per default.
