React CSS Transition contains the\n            helper <code>transit(value, duration, timingFunction, delay)</code> which makes defining\n            transitions easy. Both <code>duration</code> and <code>delay</code> accepts a numeric value\n            in milliseconds.\n         </p>\n          <SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\">\n            {inlineStyleSnippet}\n          </SyntaxHighlighter>\n          <div className={classes.block}>\n            <Demo title=\"Inline Styles Example\" component={InlineExample} source={inlineExampleSource} />\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className={classes.mainSection}>\n          <h3>Defining Transitions Using CSS Classes</h3>\n          <p>\n            React CSS Transition supports defining transitions using CSS classes.\n            Internally we use <a href={getComputedStyleURL}>getComputedStyle()</a> to extract the transitions\n            from the CSS classes automatically.
